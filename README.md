# Music-Recommender-System
This project act as purpose of the Final Project in pusuing of B.Tech Degree. This project is meant to present several ideas in Music Recommendation System and also to promote a good interface to do so.

Some of the techniques implemented in this projects are:
1. Item - Item Collaborative Filtering using Coocurence Matrix.
2. User - Item Collaborative Filtering using K-Nearest Neighbour.
3. Content Based Recommender System using Deep Neural Network on the latent factors of the items.

The Recommender Engines are fabricated in such a way that in can be used for various (simple) purpose, not only song recommendation. By simple here is recommendation that doesn't lean on complex and a lot of parameters.
